# ansible-lvm
To start using the module ansible has to be installed on the machine from where
the playbooks are executed.

1. Installing ansible

   # yum install ansible

   Or alternatively clone the ansible upstream project and execute the playbooks.

   $ git clone https://github.com/ansible/ansible.git --recursive
   $ cd ansible
   $ source hacking/env-setup
   $ sudo easy_install pip
   $ sudo pip install paramiko PyYAML Jinja2 httplib2

2. Installing the glusterfs-ansible module
   # rpm -ivh glusterfs-ansible-0.1.rpm

3. Setting up the inventory file

   Inventory file contains the list of ip-addresses or hostnames on which the
   modules are executed. For example, a sample inventory file will look like
   this:

   $ cat .inventory_list

   [snap-hosts]
   10.70.47.2
   10.70.47.3
   10.70.47.4
   10.70.47.5
   10.70.47.6

   [replicate-hosts]
   10.70.47.10
   10.70.47.11
   10.70.47.12
   10.70.47.13
   10.70.47.14

   In the above example we have two sets of hosts `snap-hosts' and
   `replicate-hosts'. The YAML file can choose on which set of hosts to run the
   module on.

3. Executing playbooks

   $ cd /usr/share/ansible/ansible-glusterfs/lvm/playbooks/
   $ ansible-playbook setup-backend.yml -i ~/.inventory_list

   The above command will execute the setup-backend.yml playbook with the
   hosts from the .inventory_list, the YAML file contains the list of hosts on
   which the playbook executes.
