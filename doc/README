# ansible-lvm
To start using the module ansible has to be installed on the machine from where
the playbooks are executed.

1. Installing ansible

   # yum install ansible

   Or alternatively clone the ansible upstream project and execute the playbooks.

   $ git clone https://github.com/ansible/ansible.git --recursive
   $ cd ansible
   $ source hacking/env-setup
   $ sudo easy_install pip
   $ sudo pip install paramiko PyYAML Jinja2 httplib2

2. Installing the glusterfs-ansible module
   # rpm -ivh glusterfs-ansible-0.1.rpm

   or

   # yum install ./glusterfs-ansible-0.1.rpm

3. Setting up the inventory file

   Inventory file contains the list of ip-addresses or hostnames on which the
   modules are executed. For example:

   $ cat .inventory_list

   [rhs_servers]
   10.70.47.2
   10.70.47.3
   10.70.47.4
   10.70.47.5
   10.70.47.6

   [replicate-hosts]
   10.70.47.10
   10.70.47.11
   10.70.47.12
   10.70.47.13
   10.70.47.14

   In the above example we have two sets of hosts `snap-hosts' and
   `replicate-hosts'. The YAML file can choose on which set of hosts to run the
   module on. If ansible-glusterfs is installed find a sample inventory file at
   /usr/share/ansible/ansible-glusterfs/doc/ansible_hosts.sample

3. Setting variables for execution

   If the bricks in the hostname are of the same type (e.g vda, vdb) then
   `group_vars' can setup and the modules can be run.

   If the bricks in the hostname are of different types (e.g sdb, vda) then host
   specific data has to be setup to run the modules.

   IMPORTANT NOTE: host specific values take precedence over group specific
   data, ensure to clear host specific details if group vars are being setup.

   a. Setting up `host_vars' or host specific data

      If the cluster has four hosts and has different combination of data which
      cannot be grouped together, then we can setup host specific variables. A
      file with the same hostname/ip (whichever is mentioned in the inventory
      file) is created for each host under host_vars directory. `host_vars'
      directory should be in the same directory where the playbooks reside.

      For example files and syntax in host_vars directory refer to
      /usr/share/ansible/ansible-glusterfs/lvm/playbooks/host_vars/

      In the inventory file mentioned in the section 3, if user prefers to run
      commands on the hosts mentioned in `rhs_servers' section, the host_vars
      directory should have five files `10.70.47.2', `10.70.47.3', `10.70.47.4',
      `10.70.47.5', and `10.70.47.6' with specific variables defined for each
      host.

   b. Setting up `group_vars' or group specific data

      If the hosts in the cluster have similar disks with the same names, for
      example all `vdb's or all `vda's then they can be grouped and the
      variables can be defined in group_vars. The `group_vars' directory should
      contain file name matching the group name in the inventory file.

      For example file and syntax for files in group_vars director refer:
      /usr/share/ansible/ansible-glusterfs/lvm/playbooks/group_vars/

      In the inventory file mentioned in the section 3, if user prefers to run
      commands on the hosts mentioned in `rhs_servers' section, the group_vars
      directory will have a file named `rhs_servers' with the variables
      defined for that group.

4. Executing playbooks

   $ cd /usr/share/ansible/ansible-glusterfs/lvm/playbooks/
   $ ansible-playbook setup-backend.yml -i ~/.inventory_list

   The above command will execute the setup-backend.yml playbook with the
   hosts from the .inventory_list, the YAML file contains the list of hosts on
   which the playbook executes.

5. Host specific data

   All host specific data goes into host_vars/hosname file. This file can be
   found under /usr/share/ansible/ansible-glusterfs/lvm/playbooks/ directory.
